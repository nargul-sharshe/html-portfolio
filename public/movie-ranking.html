<h1>The best movies according Nargul</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Christopher Nolan’s “Interstellar,” about astronauts 
    traveling to the other end of the galaxy to find 
    a new home to replace humanity’s despoiled home-world, 
    is frantically busy and earsplittingly loud.</p>

<h3>Spirited away</h3>
<p>Viewing Hiyao Miyazaki’s “Spirited Away” for the third time, 
    I was struck by a quality between generosity and love. 
    On earlier viewings I was caught up by the boundless imagination of the story. 
    This time I began to focus on the elements in the picture that didn’t need 
    to be there.</p>

<h3>The pledge</h3>
<p>Sean Penn‘s “The Pledge” begins when it seems his protagonist’s career is ending. 
    Jack Nicholson plays Jerry Black, a Nevada police detective whose retirement 
    party is interrupted by news of the brutal murder of a young girl. 
    Across the noisy room he senses a shift in tone, and joins a conversation
     between his chief and the man who will be taking over his job. Then he goes 
     along to the murder scene, perhaps out of habit or because he hasn’t officially 
     retired. 
    The little girl in a red coat is a pitiful sight with her blood staining the snow.</p>
